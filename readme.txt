A collection of customizable Bootstrap 4.1 Gutenberg blocks for the new Wordpress 5.0 block editor.

== Description ==

Bootstrap Blocks for Gutenberg is a collection of content blocks for the new [Gutenberg](https://atomicblocks.com/beginners-guide-gutenberg/?utm_source=WP.org%20Description%20Gberg%20Link&utm_campaign=wporg_desc_gberg_link) block editor.
